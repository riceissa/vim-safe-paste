INTRODUCTION                                    *safe-paste*

This plugin protects against certain attempts at "clipboard hijacking" in the
terminal by never interpreting special terminal escapes. Clipboard hijacking
is an attack where a webpage fools the user into copying something they didn't
intend to copy. In the terminal, this can be especially dangerous since
pasting can result in arbitrary commands being run.

A demo of terminal clipboard hijacking can be found here:

In addition, this plugin always uses characterwise paste when pasting from the
system clipboard. This is to avoid accidentally misplacing the pasted text.
For instance, consider the following: >

    "^"

where ^ indicates the cursor position. Suppose the user is in insert mode, and
the intent is to paste the text between the quotes. If the text was pasted
using linewise paste, one would obtain >

    pasted test^
    ""

instead of the intended >

    "pasted text^"
